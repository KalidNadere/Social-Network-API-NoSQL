## Description
The Social Networking API is a backend application designed to provide a foundation for building a social networking platform. It leverages a NoSQL database (MongoDB) to store user data, thoughts, and reactions, allowing users to interact with each other's thoughts and build social connections.

Key Features:
- User Management, Thoughts and Reactions, Friendship Management, API Endpoints

How It Works:
- User Registration, Posting Thoughts, Reacting to Thoughts, API Access

Future Enhancements:
The application can be extended with additional features and improvements, such as:
- User authentication and authorisation (ensuring only authorised users can access specific features).
- Commenting on thoughts.
- Notifications for new reactions or friend requests.
- User profile customisation.
- User search functionality.
- Improved error handling and validation.

This Social Networking API serves as the backend foundation for a social networking platform, and frontend applications can be built on top of it to provide a complete social networking experience for users.
